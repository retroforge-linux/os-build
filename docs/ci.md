# CI

## Today: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Three jobs, no secrets, on every push and pull request:

| job | what it runs | needs |
|---|---|---|
| `test` | `make test` — `verify-lock`, then every offline suite under `tests/` (boot state, post-install, update client, pairing, power, installer UI, rootfs guard, upstream-name check, …) | the runner's shell, plus `grub-common` so `test-install.sh`'s grub-editenv case runs |
| `disk` | `tests/test-select-target.sh` and `tests/test-carve.sh` — the installer's disk choice and carve, against the real GPTs captured in `docs/internal-storage.md` | `gdisk`, `mtools`, `dosfstools` from apt |
| `signing` | `make test-signing` — every case a negative against `ota/rauc/verify-signing.sh` | `build/Dockerfile`'s `signing` stage (rauc + openssl + mksquashfs, ~66 MB) |

## Today: `.github/workflows/overlay.yml` — the package compile pass

Builds the from-source overlay packages a **pull request** touches, to prove they still compile.
It publishes nothing and needs no secrets. Triggered by a change to any overlay input
(`packages/*/source.pin`, its patches, a local `PKGBUILD`, `build-overlay.sh`, `inputhash.sh`,
`build/builder.pin`, `build/snapshot.pin`, `build/lib-pins.sh`), plus `workflow_dispatch`.

| job | runner | what it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `plan` | x86 | `verify-lock-rows.sh`, then a `git diff` against the base ref → the build matrix |
| `build` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | one job per *changed* package: `build-overlay.sh --only <pkg> --no-index` (PRs and dispatches only) |
| `warm` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | on `main` only: restore the overlay cache, `build-overlay.sh --prune-retired`, save it back |

Three properties this leans on:

- **Native aarch64, so no emulation.** `build-overlay.sh`'s own binfmt probe passes and it never
  registers qemu or needs `--privileged`. `vars.OVERLAY_RUNNER` overrides the label; do **not**
  point it at a self-hosted runner while this repo is public.
- **Fork PRs run it fine**, now that nothing is published: `contents: read`, no secrets, no registry.
- **Unknown scope widens the check.** A dispatch with no diff base, or a change to the builder
  itself, selects every package rather than none.

**A push to `main` runs `warm`, not the matrix.** `warm` keeps the overlay cache the release builds
restore (`actions/cache`, key `overlay-aarch64-<hash of every overlay input>`, falling back to the
previous `main` entry). `build-overlay.sh`'s per-package stamps then rebuild only what moved, as they
do on a dev box. It has to be `main`: caches are scoped by ref, and a release runs on a **tag**, which
can read `main`'s caches but saves into a scope no later tag can see. PR caches, fork PRs included,
are never visible to a release. `workflow_dispatch` on `main` with no package list re-warms by hand;
on any other branch it forces a proof pass over a branch that never saw a PR.

### What used to be here

Until 2026-08-04 this workflow was a build-once-and-cache pipeline: it published every package to
GHCR keyed by `packages/inputhash.sh`, ran a `verify` job asserting a cold machine could reconstitute
the repo with zero compiles, and opened a **pin-bump PR** carrying each artifact's sha256 into
`packages/*/artifact.pin` — which a release build then enforced. It needed two PATs (`PIN_BUMP_PAT`,
`GHCR_PRUNE_TOKEN`), a pinned `oras`, and a prune job.

It was retired because its premise was a **dev-box** number. An overlay build costs hours under arm64
emulation on a workstation, and the store existed so nothing paid that twice. CI never paid it: on
`ubuntu-24.04-arm` the packages measured `sddm 5m, mesa 5m, gamescope 4m, scx-scheds 4m,
mangohud 3m, rauc 1m` — well under half an hour for the set (the larger set the tree started from
took ~34 minutes), against a release card build that already ran 33–41 minutes. Both PAT secrets can
be deleted; nothing reads them.

That half hour is still paid by every release build job, rebuilding identical sources almost every
time, which is what brought back the `warm` cache. It keeps none of the store's machinery: no registry, no secret,
no pin, no bot. The stamps decide freshness, and `fetchlock.sh` checks the lock rows against the
commit's sources the same as ever.

The signing job checks the committed keyring (`ota/rauc/retroforge-ca.pem`) against the committed
release certificate (`ota/rauc/release.cert.pem`). Both are public, so it runs on a fork's PR
with access to nothing. The private half — does the signing *key* match that cert — announces
itself as skipped there and runs wherever a PKI is mounted:

    PKIDIR=~/retroforge-pki make test-signing

## Today: the release image builds

`.github/workflows/image.yml` is a `workflow_call`-only builder: restore the overlay cache `warm`
saved on `main` → `build-overlay.sh --prune-retired` (a re-index when nothing moved, ~30 min cold) →
`make toolchain` → `make sdcard` or `make bundle`, with `df -h` into the step
summary.
work/ peaks near 30 GB and out/ near 21 GB against ~109 G free on the runner, measured by
`preflight.yml` — there is room, and an earlier design that deleted each stage's inputs as it went
was reverted as cleverness bought against a limit that is not there. Two thin callers invoke it on
their own triggers, because a flashable card and a field update are wanted at
different cadences:

| workflow | trigger | secrets | ships to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `release-sdcard.yml` | `card/v*` tag, or manual | none — `GITHUB_TOKEN` only; `release-cards` for its reviewer | a GitHub Release carrying the card and its checksums (the build's `manifest.lock` stays in the workflow artifact) |
| `release-bundle.yml` | `ota/v*` tag, or manual | `RAUC_CERT_PEM`/`RAUC_KEY_PEM` and `R2_*`, in the `release-signing` environment (`ota/v*` tags only) | the Cloudflare R2 bucket in `vars.R2_BUCKET`, `<channel>/` prefix, served at `https://ota.retroforge.org` (see `docs/ota.md`) |

**The tag namespaces are separate on purpose.** A bundle ships far more often than a card, so each
gets its own namespace rather than sharing a bare `v*`. That also fixes a real inversion: while
`release-sdcard.yml` owned `v*` alone and `release-bundle.yml` had no tag trigger, tagging a release
built a card and *never* a bundle. `card/v1.3.0` and `ota/v1.3.0` on one commit are the same OS
delivered two ways.

**The card is a release asset** since 2026-10-13: a release card compresses to 524 MiB (gz -6), a
quarter of GitHub's 2 GiB per-asset cap, and the release job checks the cap before uploading. It went
to R2 while it measured 5.08 GiB (2026-08-04, root still carrying an x86 stack). The repo is public
(since 2026-11), so a card downloads with no login. Nothing but OTA bundles is published to
R2 any more.

**CI is the only thing that PUBLISHES a release image**, because the reviewer gates and the signing
credentials live here. Building one is not restricted: `make sdcard` with no `RETROFORGE_DEV` produces a real release
image on a dev box, which is how a release image's first boot gets tested on hardware.

The blocker that once made a release build impossible on a clean runner is worth recording. A clean
runner has no `work/`, so it rebuilt the overlay, and because our builds are not bit-reproducible
`rootfs/fetchlock.sh` failed every run — the lock pinned those rows to artifact bytes only the last
`make relock` machine could reproduce. The lock now pins them to their **sources**, which is the
claim that survives crossing a machine. A release image's overlay is built from those same sources —
in the run itself, or by `main`'s `warm` job under stamps that hash them — so the source pins are also
its byte provenance. See `packages/README.md`.

## Today: the FEX guest image, `.github/workflows/release-fex-guest.yml`

Not part of any OS image. It builds `packages/mesa-x86` (our Mesa pin and patches for x86_64 +
i686) on an `ubuntu-24.04` x86_64 runner, composes it over FEX's ArchLinux RootFS, and uploads the
squashfs as a workflow artifact. With `publish` ticked it cuts a Release `fex-guest/v<version>` on
the built commit (reviewer: the `release-cards` environment), after the same 2 GiB per-asset check
as the card. **`workflow_dispatch` is its only trigger**: no push, tag or schedule, so nothing
starts it but a person. The version comes from the tree (`<mesa pkgver>-<guest.pin revision>`),
not from an input. Devices only use a published guest once
`rootfs/overlay/usr/share/retroforge/steam/x86-guest.pin` names it; its Release asset url is
public since the repo is (2026-11). See `packages/mesa-x86/README.md`.

## Bundle signing and publishing

An `ota/v*` tag runs `release-bundle.yml` as `prep` → `build` → `release` → `notes`. `build`
assembles the rootfs with no key and no environment, so it never waits on a reviewer. `release`
signs the bundle (`make sign-bundle PKIDIR=$RUNNER_TEMP/pki`) and publishes it to the R2 bucket
behind **one** deployment gate, the `release-signing` environment: approving it means "this tag
ships". The signed bundle is uploaded as a workflow artifact before the publish step, so a failed
publish can be finished from a workstation with `make publish-bundle`. `notes` then cuts the
notes-only GitHub Release. A manual dispatch signs with an ephemeral dev cert every device rejects
and skips publishing — it proves the bundle assembles and the verity hashes compute. The `release`
job's steps live in the reusable `sign-publish-bundle.yml` (inputs `channel`, `environment`,
`publish`, and the names of the cert/key secrets), so every channel signs and publishes the same way.

- **The secrets are environment-scoped.** `RAUC_CERT_PEM` / `RAUC_KEY_PEM` and the `R2_*` secrets
  and variables live in `release-signing`, whose deployment policy accepts `ota/v*` tags only;
  until the repo went public (2026-11) GitHub Free had no environments and they were repo-wide.
  It has a required reviewer (since 2026-11-09), so `release` waits for that single approval;
  `release-cards` has the same reviewer. Keys are written to `$RUNNER_TEMP`, never the workspace — the
  repo tree gets uploaded as artifacts and cached.
- **The run ends published or red.** Missing R2 credentials fail the job before anything is
  signed, and `ota/publish-bundle.sh` checks the bundle against the device keyring and refuses a
  DEV-image payload before it moves a byte.
- `verify-signing.sh` asserts the key matches the committed cert *as public-key digests*, so a
  stale or truncated secret fails there instead of producing bundles no device accepts.
- **The CA key never reaches a runner.** That is what the two-level PKI is for: if the release key
  leaks, mint a new cert offline under the same CA, commit it, update the secret — no device is
  affected. See `ota/gen-signing-ca.sh`.
- Still worth considering: signing via an HSM/KMS the runner reaches by OIDC, so the key never
  exists as a file. A key that can push arbitrary code to devices with no serial console is a
  large thing to keep in a CI secret store.

## Not here yet, and why

**cosign-signed artifacts and published update manifests** — the original Phase 7 scope, CI
patterns borrowed from ublue-os/image-template, for the single unified image (every supported SoC
in one kernel + boot artifact). All of it sits on top of a working image build. The runtime update
mechanism stays RAUC A/B over read-only Btrfs roots.

## The standing caveat

CI green is not evidence about the device. The self-test runs the **build container's** rauc
against the shipped config; the device runs its own (the pinned snapshot's). A 1.14-on-device /
1.15-in-container skew is exactly how the dm-verity install bug reached hardware. Only an on-device
`rauc install` is evidence about the device.
