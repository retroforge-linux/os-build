# Offline test for /usr/bin/retroforge-update — the OTA client the shell drives.
#
#   tests/test-update.sh
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The caller (the RetroForge shell plugin) PARSES STDOUT, under a contract
# inherited from the steamos-update interface. `check` printing the wrong thing is not
# a cosmetic bug — anything on stdout that is not a version string becomes "an update is available,
# called <that>", and a stray traceback would offer the fleet an update named `Traceback`. Every
# case below is really one assertion: does the shipped file honour a contract we do not control.
#
# The second reason is duplicate detection. The caller refuses to re-offer a version it already applied,
# so an identity that changes between two calls makes one update look like two, and an identity
# that never changes makes a real update invisible. That rule is written TWICE — in shell in
# ota/genbundle.sh and in Python here — and `identity-rules-agree` below is the only thing that
# makes them stay the same rule. Phase 2 exists because those two strings had drifted apart.
#
# HOW IT WORKS: the real, shipped rootfs/overlay/usr/bin/retroforge-update is executed — not a copy, not a
# sed-mangled variant. It exposes the environment seams documented in its own header
# (RETROFORGE_RELEASE_FILE, RETROFORGE_OTA_CONFIG, RETROFORGE_OTA_USER_CONFIG, RETROFORGE_OTA_STAGE, RETROFORGE_SHELL_SETTINGS,
# RETROFORGE_CURL, RETROFORGE_OTA_URL) and they exist for this file. curl is stubbed on disk so no test
# touches the network. Nothing here needs rauc, a bus, a server or a device.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT COVER: the install half. `apply`'s D-Bus conversation with rauc needs a bus, and
# the only evidence that matters about a real install is a hardware one (see docs/worklog/DONE.md). What is
# covered is everything up to InstallBundle, which is where every decision gets made.

# date. A caller is not obliged to have asked first.
#
# WHY IT MATTERS more than a wasted transfer: usr/lib/rauc/post-install.sh gives the target slot a
# fresh per-slot /var and re-arms its boot conf. A redundant apply therefore overwrites the
# PREVIOUS RELEASE — the rollback target — and puts the device on a trial boot of what it was
# already running. The whole point of A/B is that the other side survives.

# Note that the request count cannot detect this: rauc streams the bundle, so a redundant install
# makes exactly the same one curl request (the manifest) as a refused one. The exit code and stdout
# are the discriminators, because they are also what the caller reads.

# THE DEFAULT ACTION OF THIS PROGRAM IS AN INSTALL, so what main() does with an argument it does not
# recognise decides whether a typo writes the inactive slot. It used to fall through to apply for
# anything unrecognised -- `--enable-duplicate-detection` landed in the right place by accident.
#
# The two shapes have OPPOSITE right answers, and this case asserts both, because either one alone
# is satisfiable by a parser that is wrong in the other direction:
#
#   a FLAG must still reach apply. Callers grow flags on this command line over time --
#   --enable-duplicate-detection is itself one that arrived after the interface existed -- and a
#   client that refused an unfamiliar one would stop applying updates FLEET-WIDE and silently, the
#   day Valve shipped the next one.
#
#   a WORD must not. `chekc` is not a request to install over the other slot.
#
# The channel is the up-to-date one from the case above, deliberately: apply then answers 0 with a
# bare `100%` while a refusal answers 7 with nothing, so the two paths are told apart by what the caller
# would actually read, and neither needs a bus.
