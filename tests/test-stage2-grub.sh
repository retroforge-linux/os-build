# Offline parity test for the phase-5 stage-2 GRUB data model.
#
# Three files have to agree about what a board IS, and each of them is edited for a different
# reason, so they drift silently:
#
#   boot/boards.map                              build-time catalog: id / menu name / dtb / bootargs
#   kernel/dts/qcom/*.dts                        the DTBs that actually ship
#   rootfs/overlay/usr/lib/retroforge/devices/*.conf   the identity the RUNNING system reports
#
# and then boot/gen-grub-cfg.sh turns the first into a grub.cfg whose per-slot cmdline has to match
# image/partition-table.txt. A mismatch anywhere is a board that cannot be selected, a menu entry
# that boots the wrong DTB, or a slot that mounts the other slot's /var.
#
#   tests/test-stage2-grub.sh
#
# Everything runs on the host with no root, no device and no cross-build: the configs under test
# are GENERATED here into a temp dir, so this never skips and never asserts against a stale
# out/boot from some earlier build. Run via `make test`.
