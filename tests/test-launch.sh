# Offline test for retroforge-launch: how a ROM card starts an emulator AppImage, and how it stops.
#
#   tests/test-launch.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Each rule in retroforge-launch was a crash on hardware (DuckStation, Pocket Max,
# 2026-10-03), and none of them shows in a quick manual run that never presses Exit:
#
#   - exec'ing the AppImage / AppRun: Qt finds no platform plugin and aborts at start.
#   - the emulator inside the launcher's process group: OGUI's Reaper.reap() reaches it twice
#     (`kill -- -<launcher>` after `kill <emulator>`), DuckStation reads the second SIGTERM as
#     "force quit" and abort()s on Exit.
#   - forwarding SIGTERM from the launcher: the same second signal.
#   - the mount dying with SIGTERM: the emulator's files vanish while it shuts down.
#   - no sweep: a double Exit (SIGKILL) leaves a dead mount behind.
#
# The AppImage, the emulator and fusermount3 are fakes that record what happened. OGUI's Exit is
# replayed exactly as reaper.gd does it. Runs on the host with no root, no device and no build.
