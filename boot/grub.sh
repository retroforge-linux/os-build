# retroforge GRUB build: the ESP GRUB that picks the slot, and the per-slot stage-2 configs.
#
# Builds GRUB for arm64-efi from the pinned GNU GRUB 2.14 release tarball plus boot/patches/grub/
# (the retroforge module), and generates the configs that go with it. Emits:
#   out/boot/grub-esp.efi            \EFI\BOOT\bootaa64.efi, the slot picker embedded
#   out/boot/grubaa64.efi            the same modules, no embedded config (stage 2)
#   out/boot/grub-a.cfg, out/boot/grub-b.cfg
#   out/boot/fonts/dejavu-mono.pf2
#   out/boot/grubenv
#   out/boot/grub-editenv            static aarch64, for RAUC's grub backend on the device
#   out/boot/steamcl-version, out/boot/fonts/default.pf2   what an older root's hook expects
#
#   boot/grub.sh
#
# Run inside the build image (needs the arm64 toolchain, the autotools + autogen, gawk and
# grub-common — see build/Dockerfile):
#   docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/src -w /src retroforge-build boot/grub.sh
#
# There is no ./bootstrap step and no gnulib checkout: the release tarball already vendors gnulib.
# See boot/grub.pin for why that matters and what the patch set covers.

# Patch 0003 adds a module to grub-core/Makefile.core.def, GRUB's module manifest. That file is
# input to autogen (via gentpl.py), which writes grub-core/Makefile.core.am, which automake INLINES
# into grub-core/Makefile.in — and the release tarball ships all of those pre-generated, from
# before our module existed. So the manifest edit does nothing until the chain is re-run:
# autogen.sh is gentpl.py + autogen + autoreconf, in that order.
#
# This is the one autotools step in the GRUB build. It is not the tarball's `bootstrap`: bootstrap
# is what needs a separately-checked-out gnulib at an exact revision, and the release tarball
# already vendors gnulib under grub-core/lib/gnulib. Hence no gnulib pin.

# Boot font. Prefer the tree-built grub-mkfont (needs libfreetype-dev in the container); fall back

# SIZE IS THE ONLY MENU-SCALE LEVER WE HAVE. gfxterm draws the menu in a fixed-size bitmap font at
# whatever resolution the firmware hands us, and we never set gfxmode -- GRUB's default is already
# `auto`, i.e. the panel's preferred (native) mode. So the menu's physical size is set here and
# nowhere else; adding `set gfxmode=auto` to grub.cfg would parse, ship and change nothing.
#
# Forcing a small gfxmode instead is NOT the alternative it looks like: these are Qualcomm ABL/GOP
# devices that generally expose only the native mode, so the request falls back to native silently
# -- and it would also change what gfxpayload=keep hands the kernel.

# 60x33 cells on a 1080 board and 80x45 on an S2 -- comfortable at both ends. Revisit if a panel
# outside that range joins the catalog.
